# BigSMILESCanonicalization

This repository contains the validation of the algorithms that provide a canonical BigSMILES representation, developed by Bruno Salomão Leão during his Master's. The code relies on the conversion of BigSMILES into tree automaton, which can be minimized into a unique representation. Finally, the minimal automaton is translated back into BigSMILES.
