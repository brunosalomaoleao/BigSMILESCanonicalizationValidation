# Validation
The files Validation I and Validation II have, respectively, distinct representations of the same polymers with their canonical BigSMILES and the canonical BigSMILES of several materials. 

The folders contain the figures generated while the code produced Validation I and Validation II. Their structure is the following:
- Validation I (or Validation II) 
    - Polymer1
        - Direction1
        - Direction2
        - ...
    - Polymer2
      - Direction1
      - Direction2
      - ...
    - ...
 
Each folder has the results for a polymer. Each polymer folder has the results for the different directions.
